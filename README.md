# Tyler's Portfolio Website
Welcome to the repository for my current portfolio website! The site acts as a showcase of my skills, education and pass project experiences.
## Technologies Used
I utilized React and Vite to build an efficient single page application. To add and style content, I used HTML5 and CSS3. To implement a navigation bar and project menu, I used React Router.

- Ensure you are using Node.js v20 at a minimum
- To install necessary node modules, execute `cd portfolio && npm i`
